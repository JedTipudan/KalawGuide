# AI Disclosure Log — KalawGuide

This document discloses the use of AI tools in the development of KalawGuide, as required for the ITMSD1 Inter-Class Mobile Hackathon.

---

## AI Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Amazon Q Developer (AWS) | Primary development assistant — architecture, code generation, screen implementation, debugging |

---

## Scope of AI Assistance

### Architecture and Planning
- Project structure design (Expo Router file-based routing, role-based navigation)
- Database schema design (13 SQLite tables with foreign keys and constraints)
- Authentication architecture (SecureStore, session management, Google OAuth flow)
- Offline-first strategy (SQLite-first, sync queue design)

### Code Generation
- All screen implementations (auth, tourist, business owner, administrator)
- Reusable component library (KalawButton, KalawInput, KalawCard, GoogleSignInButton)
- Design token system (colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows)
- AuthContext and ThemeContext providers
- SQLite migration and seed scripts
- Budget calculation service (deterministic, no AI inference)
- KalawAssistance engine (deterministic keyword matching, no paid AI API)
- Utility functions (generateId, formatCurrency, safeNumber, date helpers)

### Design Implementation
- Color tokens extracted from Figma design (`#F7F8F5` light / `#0B1720` dark)
- Typography scale (Manrope headings, Inter body)
- Spacing and radius scales matching Figma specifications
- Light Mode and Dark Mode theming

### Documentation
- README.md
- .env.example
- This AI disclosure log

## Human Responsibilities

- Figma design creation (all visual designs)
- Project concept and requirements definition
- Feature prioritization decisions
- Testing on physical devices
- Google Cloud Console OAuth configuration
- EAS Build configuration and signing
- Final review and approval of all generated code
- Hackathon presentation and demonstration

## AI Contribution Estimate

| Area | Estimated AI Contribution |
|---|---|
| Screen implementation | ~85% |
| Architecture design | ~60% |
| Business logic / calculations | ~70% |
| Database schema | ~65% |
| Documentation | ~80% |
| Visual design (Figma) | 0% — human only |
| Testing on device | 0% — human only |
| OAuth configuration | 0% — human only |

These percentages are estimates. All AI-generated code was reviewed by the development team before inclusion.

## Important Notes

- No paid AI API is used at runtime. KalawAssistance uses deterministic keyword matching against locally stored data.
- Budget calculations use deterministic mathematical formulas — no AI inference is involved in financial estimates.
- Emergency contact numbers are marked as unverified in seed data. No AI invented or verified any contact information.
- All prices shown are either user-entered estimates or administrator-verified values. No AI invented prices.
